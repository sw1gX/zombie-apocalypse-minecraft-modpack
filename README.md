# 🧟‍♂️ Toast's Wasteland / Minecraft
The version is 1.16.5, a minecraft modpack centered to make a *realistic* Minecraft Zombie Apocalypse. It has realistic guns, cool animations and a big city filled with apocalypse.
Just note that this is still **IN!** development.
It is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!** to install **Modrinth App** or other mod launchers to export the mod into your launcher so that you can play the modpack, but other then nothing, **Modrinth is recommended for the modpack**, else you can just try to export it on a different mod launcher.
# ⌚ Release Date
The modpack might be releasing after 2-3 devlog videos releases so i think the modpack **will** be finished and free to play, other then that so there's gonna be a **Pro Version**, which adds more things rather then the free edition, but **Pro Version** is not releasing instantly.
# ❗❗ Bad News
The modpack is crashing, i don't know why, so the modpack is gonna be discontinued and i may probably make a **Remastered** version of the modpack, so i hope you enjoyed that it lasted but yeah, goodbye!

# 🔍 FAQ
- What versions this modpack will use?
> Right now, we're using 1.16.5 but if **Timeless and Classics** updates to a newer version then we'll upgrade to that, but right now 1.16.5 is the use for the modpack. If you do not like the version, im sorry but you gotta wait until **Timeless and Classics** releases a newer version of the mod.
- Will the modpack come out to Fabric?
> No, it won't and stop begging for the modpack to release on fabric.
- When is better combat coming out for the modpack?
> Uhh, never because theres no 1.16.5 version for it.
